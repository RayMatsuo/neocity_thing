        My name's Marcie. I'm just a Japanese trans girl bored out of her mind
        at work.<br />
        I made this so I can vent and make some cool(at least for me) thing
        while company wages. (My boss is sitting right next to me but he can't
        read English luckily)<br />
        <br />
        I don't know why anyone would come to this place, but if anyone does,
        I hope they would remember that I existed. So that piece of myself
        would live on.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
      <div style="display: none;">
        My parents weren't in a good term with each others for as long as i
        remember.<br />
        It didn't bother me, or more specifically, I was proud that it didnt
        bother me at all.<br />
        I was proud that i didn't get hungry(due to undiagnosed autism) so it
        would cost less to raise me.<br />
        I was proud that I didn't require much.<br />
        Even before they got divorced I was
        <span>clinging onto my mother's approval and attention</span>.<br />
        <br />
        According to my mother, she did not receive tender love and care from
        her mother.<br />
        She was brushed off and horribly critisized by her parents.<br />
        <br />
        Therefore she sought out what she couldn't receive in me .<br />
        Consistent love and adoration, shared interests and so on.<br />
        (Even to this day, I fear that she find out i like music other than
        jazz.)<br />
        <br />
        And she never takes my anger seriously, going as far as to mock me.<br />
        (which i presume what happened between her and her mother.)<br />
        <br />
        I have never had a single moment of heart to heart conversation with
        her.(or with anyone to that matter)<br />
        Only time we had any serious conversations were when I was in
        trouble.<br />
        <br />
        Then the divorce happened.<br />
        <br />
        I wasn't bothered by it at all, and naturally took my mother's side in
        divorce.<br />
        <br />
        My father may not be a great father figure for me, but he was a great
        friend of mine.<br />
        At least to me he was a decent man.<br />
        <br />
        But it didn't even cross my mind to be with him. (I don't know why)<br />
        <br />
        After a few month, the first abandonment happened.<br />
        I cannot recall what caused the first one(but most likely because my
        desk was dirty).<br />
        <br />
        My mother stood at the front door of the apartment.<br />
        She was holding her bag and suitcase(?), ready to leave.<br />
        I was on the floor, clinging onto her leg.<br />
        begging and crying not to leave. More scared than ever in her whole
        life.<br />
        <br />
        I don't know how long it lasted, but after a long time, she caved
        in.<br />
        And ordered me, still exhausted from horus of begging and crying, to
        clean my desk.<br />
        <br />
        There was no consolation,apology,hug, or literally anything for making
        her child feel that way.<br />
        I wasn't even a child to her, just an object she take what she was
        deprived of<br />
        In her eyes i was wrong and what she did was righteous.<br />
        <br />
        I cleaned my desk in frenzy, fearing another abandonment.<br />
        <br />
        Also it's a good time to mention, I was diagnosed for ADHD around this
        time.<br />
        But i was not informed of what it meant to have ADHD, which experience
        of mine was from ADHD and so on.<br />
        I was not even aware of effective ADHD medication at that time, which
        the doctors should have informed me of to<br />
        begin with.<br />
        <br />
        My mother knew that I had ADHD and still decided to punish me, abandon
        me for something banal as a fucking dirty desk.<br />
